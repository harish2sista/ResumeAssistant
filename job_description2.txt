By the time you end your time with us, you will have been given the opportunity to truly make a real impact in the future of Bose and your career!

Opportunities don't stop at your day-to-day work. While you're getting an in depth look at your area of expertise, we'll expose you to other areas of the company. Our Co-Ops are given the opportunity to connect with senior leadership across the business to understand different perspectives at Bose. You'll network with other Co-Ops and colleagues to grow your network for the future! 

Timeframe - January-June 2025

THE ROLE 

The goal of our team is to develop novel AI-powered audio processing algorithms. The twist is that our algorithms must run in real-time, on physical devices, for applications such as voice pickup, hearing augmentation and ones we haven't even thought of yet. As part of the team, you will work with experts in machine learning (ML), digital signal processing (DSP), software engineering and psychoacoustics to prototype and implement new algorithms.

Bose has a strong history of combining creative thinking with cutting-edge technology in the audio domain. We are looking for candidates passionate about machine learning and audio to help us shape the next chapter in the future of Bose!


Responsibilities:
- The majority of your time will be devoted to prototyping, implementing and evaluating ML algorithms, curating and developing internal resources, and regularly presenting your findings. 
- You will integrate your novel solutions into new and existing systems and platforms to deliver new proofs of concept. 
- You will be able to contribute to projects, which will be shipped to Bose customers, apply for patents, or submit papers to top-tier AI and signal processing conferences (e.g., NeurIPS, ICASSP, Interspeech, etc.).
 

Requirements:

- Currently pursuing or recently finished (<6 months) a graduate-level degree in ML, Computer Science, Music Technology or a related field.
- Expertise in applied audio ML (TensorFlow and/or PyTorch, TFLite and/or ONNX is a plus) and audio DSP (Python, Matlab and/or C/C++).
- Hands-on experience in at least one of the following research topics: Audio source separation, Speech enhancement, Microphone array signal processing, TinyML, Generative audio modeling.
- Familiarity with methods for spatial sound synthesis and/or room acoustics simulation/analysis is a plus.
- Strong communication skills. You will be presenting your work to a large interdisciplinary community.
